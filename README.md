# Game of Life

This is an API that returns iterations of the Conway's Game of Life

See [java script
client](https://github.com/msergeant/game-of-life-client) for a client
that consumes this API.

I used [this
tutorial](https://grisha.org/blog/2017/04/27/simplistic-go-web-app/) for
guidance while building my first Golang web app.
